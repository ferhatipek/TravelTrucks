## 🎯 Implementation Features

### State Management (Redux Toolkit)

The project uses modern Redux Toolkit with three main slices:

- **`campers`** - stores campers list, current camper, loading state
- **`filters`** - active search filters (location, vehicle type, equipment)
- **`favorites`** - list of favorite camper IDs (persisted in localStorage)

### API Integration

- All API requests are separated into a service layer (`src/services/api.js`)
- Uses axios for HTTP requests
- Implements error handling and loading states
- Supports filtering and pagination

### Component Architecture

- Each component has its own folder with JSX file and CSS module
- Uses functional components with hooks
- PropTypes for props validation
- DRY principle - avoiding code duplication

### Routing

- React Router v6 with nested routes support
- Lazy loading for pages optimization
- 404 error handling (redirect to home)
- SPA support in production (vercel.json)

## 🌐 API

The project uses MockAPI for demonstration purposes:

**Base URL:** `https://66b1f8e71ca8ad33d4f5f63e.mockapi.io`

**Endpoints:**

- `GET /campers` - get list of all campers
- `GET /campers/:id` - get details of specific camper

**Filtering:** Implemented on frontend with support for:

- Location search (case-insensitive)
- Vehicle type filtering (panelTruck, fullyIntegrated, alcove)
- Equipment filtering (AC, transmission, kitchen, TV, bathroom)

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is ready for deployment on cloud platforms.

**Important:** Includes `vercel.json` for proper client-side routing.
